ðŸ–‹ Digit Recognizer â€“ Train on MNIST, Predict from Any Image
This Python program trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and allows you to predict digits from your own images.

It automatically preprocesses arbitrary images into MNIST-like format (28Ã—28 grayscale, centered) so you can test it with photos, scans, or screenshots of handwritten numbers.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Full MNIST Training â€“ Uses TensorFlow/Keras to train a CNN from scratch or load a saved model (mnist_model.h5).

Image Preprocessing â€“ Converts any input image into MNIST style:

Converts to grayscale

Inverts if background is light

Crops the digit area

Resizes to 28Ã—28 pixels and centers it

Normalizes pixel values to the range [-1, 1]

Data Augmentation â€“ Adds random rotations, shifts, shears, and zooms to improve model generalization.

Tkinter File Picker â€“ Easily select one or more images from your computer.

Side-by-Side Prediction View â€“ Displays original and preprocessed image with predicted label.
